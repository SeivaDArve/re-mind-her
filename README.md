## Description
A simple script to practice sqlite3 manipulation through Bash (to increase the complexity and dive deeper into databases). This script listens to the 'date' command and reminds me to take at least 1 picture per week with my soul mate.

It will have a security feature: The repository and the code is listed public and FOSS, but the sensitive content is encrypted and hidden
